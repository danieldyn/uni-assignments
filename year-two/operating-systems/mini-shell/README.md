# Assignment Mini Shell

A shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a text-based user interface for operating systems.
Bash is both an interactive command language and a scripting language.
It is used to interact with the file system, applications, operating system and more.

For this assignment, I built a Bash-like shell with minimal functionalities like traversing the file system, running applications, redirecting their output or piping the output from one application into the input of another.

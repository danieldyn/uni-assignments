# Operating Systems
# -- Assignments --

This directory features my implementation for five Operating Systems assignments:

- Mini libc
- ELF loader
- Parallel firewall
- Mini shell
- Async web server

Languages: C

The `mini-libc`, `elf-loader`, `parallel-firewall`, `mini-shell` and `async-web-server` subdirectories also contain a 
`README.md` file with a summary of the solved tasks, according to the limitations, assumptions and purpose of the tasks.
These assignments were designed to help solidify the five chapters that were part of the Operating Systems course: Software Stack, 
Data, Compute, I/O and Application Interaction.

# Numerical Methods
# -- Assignments --

This directory features my implementation for the two Numerical Methods assignments:

- Numerical methods for matrices
- Numerical methods for functions

Languages: MATLAB (GNU Octave)

The `function-numerical-methods` and `matrix-numerical-methods` subdirectories also contain a 
`README.md` file with a summary of the solved tasks, according to the limitations, assumptions
and purpose of the tasks. These assignments were designed to present real situations and problems 
that can be solved using numerical methods, fully documenting the process and the methods in order 
to allow implementing several MATLAB helper functions.

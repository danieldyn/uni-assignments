# Data Structures and Algorithms 
# -- Assignments --

This directory features my implementation for the two Data Structures and Algorithms assignments:

- A simplified web browser with tabs and history
- A simulation of a network of satellites

Languages: C, Makefile

The `satellite-network` and `web-browser` directories also contain a `README.md` file with a summary of the 
solved tasks, according to the limitations, assumptions and purpose of the tasks. These assignments were 
designed to apply fundamental DSA concepts in the C programming language.

# Computer Programming and Programming Languages 2 (Hardware Software Interface)
# Medium Assembly Tasks

## Overview

As a checkpoint in the process of learning the Assembly language, this assignment features four different tasks 
solved entirely in ASM. These tasks are functions that solve a certain problem. These implementations can be
seen as functions that are assembled with NASM and linked with another object file that calls the ASM functions
to perform the tasks.

## Running the Tasks

- For consistency and structure, there will be a separate directory for each task
- Each directory will contain:
  - a README for the description of the task
  - a Makefile
  - a supporting C file for checking the result
  - the ASM implementation of the task
